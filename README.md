 1. *Selling Price by Brand*:
   - *Top Brands by Selling Price*: 
     - Maruti leads with the highest total selling price.
     - Hyundai, BMW, and Mahindra also have high total selling prices.
     - Brands like Opel, Daewoo, and others have much lower selling prices.
   - *Distribution*: The chart suggests a significant disparity in selling prices across brands, with a few leading brands contributing to a majority of the sales.

   - *Bar Chart*:
     - This chart likely shows the number of different car brands based on their fuel type.
     - Maruti appears to have the highest count, followed by Hyundai, Mahindra, and Toyota.
     - The distribution is less skewed compared to the selling price, but some brands still dominate.
   - *Pie Chart*:
     - The pie chart further visualizes the distribution of brands by fuel type, reinforcing the dominance of a few brands.

 3. *Selling Price by Cubic Capacity*:
   - *Cubic Capacity Impact*:
     - Maruti again leads, indicating that its cars, regardless of engine size, tend to have high selling prices.
     - Brands like Hyundai and Mahindra also have significant selling prices across different engine capacities.
   - *Distribution*: Thereâ€™s a trend showing that higher cubic capacity might correlate with higher selling prices, but the specifics aren't entirely clear without more detailed data.
